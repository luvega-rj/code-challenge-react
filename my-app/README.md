# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

 ## App.js
This repository contains a simple React application that allows users to add, sort, and delete transactions.

### Installation
Clone the repository using git clone.
Navigate to the project directory using cd.
Install the dependencies using npm install.
Start the application using npm start.
### Usage
Once the application is started, you can add transactions by filling out the form at the top of the page. The transactions will appear in a table below the form. You can sort the table by clicking on the table headers. You can also delete transactions by clicking on the "Delete" button next to each transaction.

## table.js
This repository contains a simple React component that displays transactions in a table.

## Props
The Table component takes the following props:

transactions (array): An array of transaction objects to be displayed in the table.
handleSort (function): A function to handle sorting the transactions. When a user clicks on a table header, this function is called with the type of the column to sort by.
handleDelete (function): A function to handle deleting a transaction. When a user clicks on the "Delete" button next to a transaction, this function is called with the id of the transaction to delete.
Usage
To use the Table component, simply import it into your React application and include it in your JSX code.

## jsx
Copy code
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import Table from './Table';

function App() {
  const [transactions, setTransactions] = useState([]);

  // ...

  return (
    <div>
      <Table
        transactions={transactions}
        handleSort={handleSort}
        handleDelete={handleDelete}
      />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
